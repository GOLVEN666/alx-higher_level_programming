# Project Title

## Description

This repository contains solutions to a series of tasks aimed at learning how to fetch internet resources using Python's `urllib` and `requests` packages. The tasks cover various aspects such as making HTTP requests, handling response data, decoding JSON resources, and manipulating data from external services.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will be able to:

- Fetch internet resources with the Python package `urllib`
- Decode `urllib` body response
- Utilize the Python package `requests` for making HTTP requests (requests is way simpler than urllib)
- Make HTTP GET requests
- Make HTTP POST/PUT/etc. requests
- Fetch JSON resources
- Manipulate data from an external service

## Copyright - Plagiarism

You are expected to come up with solutions for the tasks yourself to meet the learning objectives specified above. Plagiarism in any form is strictly prohibited and will result in removal from the program.
